I’m going to ask him in person before class to clarify.

In the mean time I’m trying to understand why a metronome has those specific bpm timings and why the numbers go up and down by particular intervals as well as why I can’t use 125bpm instead of 126bpm — especially in an age where free metronome apps and other online tools don’t seem to have that limitation because that seems incredibly arbitrary and a bit asinine.",1.0,0.0,0.0,Question about timings on a Standard Metronome,https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/d0r83i/question_about_timings_on_a_standard_metronome/,,"What is the rationale behind the specific BPM timings on a metronome, especially in relation to the symbolic music image?",Rhythm & Meter,Reasoning,They are based on historical practices in music composition.,They are designed for convenience in digital music production.,They reflect traditional tempo markings used in classical music.,They are arbitrary and can be changed freely.,Tempo & Phrasing,Yash

Here are the two passage interpretations I am stuck between, planned to be played at \~120bpm:  [https://imgur.com/a/W1Lb7oj](https://imgur.com/a/W1Lb7oj)

I suppose I am trying to compare the ""musicality"" of using the triplet over landing it on the sub-beats for a listener, and looking for outside opinions. ~~From what I can hear in the original material, the first one is probably more faithful if I remove the first tie~~ (I'm finding it hard to be confident in that anymore). A dotted eighth lasts 0.75 beats, and the triplet notes each last 2/3=\~0.67 beats. I've seen it written both ways in fan work, and it doesn't help that there are many official renditions of the piece too!

Because of the ties at the end, I figure that ""musically"" it feels like the descent is even in both. After writing it and listening to the replay over and over, the difference seems almost negligible to the point where I wonder if I'm making a fuss over nothing. The only effective thing I notice as a listener without dissecting it is the second note of the descent coming in a hair earlier.

I'm currently working out the melody before adding ornaments for an instrument that doesn't use rests, and I enjoy the last note being held so these are what I would like to decide between unless someone else has a suggestion.

Edit: While being faithful might be important, I am also looking to learn why the triplet sounds different and when it might sound better. Also, there are multiple adaptations such as the animation version where the note is tied:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvNnL3PGXY&amp;t=23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvNnL3PGXY&amp;t=23)

Looking around on the internet some people say the difference is in the tempo (fast songs being in 12/8), others say it has to do with the phrasing of the lyrics/melody, while other claim you have to look at the chord changes.

Here is the song in question, with a page of the sheet music I am making.

[https://youtu.be/lKw6uqtGFfo?t=45](https://youtu.be/lKw6uqtGFfo?t=45)  [https://www.dropbox.com/s/z6lgyhr7k0iy9bb/12%208%20vs%206%208.PNG?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z6lgyhr7k0iy9bb/12%208%20vs%206%208.PNG?dl=0)

I put the link timestamp (45s) at the start of verse 2. If you listen to 1.55 you've heard all the 3 different parts of the song.

Looking online there seems to be divide about this specific song as well. [https://www.praisecharts.com/songs/details/70824/who-you-say-i-am-sheet-music/lead-melody](https://www.praisecharts.com/songs/details/70824/who-you-say-i-am-sheet-music/lead-melody) puts it in 6/8 while [https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0182718#](https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0182718#) puts it in 12/8.

While looking at it myself when just feeling it, i'd say it is 6/8, just by the tempo alone probably. But when looking at the phrasing and chord-changes 12/8 would make sense (although we don't use 8/4 when a phrase takes 2 measures do we?). But then again in the bridge the chord changes every 6 counts, so then there 6/8 would be logical imho.

One of my variations is going to be a fugue. I only use the first 10 bars of Beethoven's fifth for my fugue, whereas the other variations use the entire first theme. The subject entries in my fugue exposition go SATB, in that order. Here is my subject:

The countersubject that I thought up has like no contrapuntal errors with the subject at all, which is great. Just 1 problem though.

You see, I am treating the eighth note as my unit since that is the shortest note that appears in my subject. And this worked well for my countersubject. But I am writing this fugue for string quartet, so it is a 4 voice fugue. And there are only so many things I can do in 2/4 time with the eighth note as my shortest duration. Since I have 4 voices in my fugue, I'm worried that at some point I will get homophony(same rhythm) instead of the polyphony(different rhythm) I have right now. I'm not worried about melodic independence, that will be easy. I'm only worried that at some point, previously independent rhythms will become one and the same. It is way easier for me to avoid this rhythmic homophony when the sixteenth note is my unit and I'm in 4/4. But here, the eighth note is my unit and I'm in 2/4, both making it harder to  avoid rhythmic homophony.

What is the “welcome change” between the first inversion of IV and VI if they will both have the same note in the bass? It doesn’t specify that VI is also in first inversion for the example. 

I don’t know what they mean about the leading tone either. It sounds like they mean that there can be a scenario where the leading tone is the highest note in a V chord, and the leading tone can remain on top while moving to the IV chord.

So if we take the key of C and B is the leading tone, this means a second inversion G chord has to be played for V. Then an F chord has to be played that keeps B, the leading tone. There can be an 11th from F to two Bs up.

Ok nm I’m lost.
